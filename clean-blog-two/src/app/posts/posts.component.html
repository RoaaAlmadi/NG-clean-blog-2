        <p> Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one:
          a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet,
          in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center â€” an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.
          The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.
